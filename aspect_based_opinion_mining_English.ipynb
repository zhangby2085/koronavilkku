      "['While I understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do, the app checking my location consistently at 1am, and 3am is crazy! It is not checking my location when I am actually out and about during the day. I will be deleting this as I find that for me, it is worthless. Based on reply..let me correct that to exposure checks at 2+am, 3+am, 4+am, 5+am, do no good for me as thats when I\\'m home asleep. Those are the check times that have been reported to me. Bluetooth has always had security issues! Hackers can get into our phones via Bluetooth. Search Google: \"Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution,\" ... on MSN News/Gizmodo, 9/10/2020. Also, Bluetooth constantly searches, draining batteries. I think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks, then the VDH could use that to cross-reference to see if any app users were around an app reported Covid-19 victim. Doesn\\'t run daily or even weekly checks. Have been in contact with the developers previously about this issue which so far can only be rectified by uninstalling then reinstalling. I am wondering if it stops checking forever even if you only briefly turn off bluetooth, instead of ensuring that connection.. Can\\'t review this app when it doesn\\'t run. After installing on my Pixel 4xl, I try to run it and it says \"Internal error, please try again\". Subsequent retries are futile as I get the same error repeatedly. When I try to sign up for exposure notifications I keep receiving the following error message, \"Internal error, please try again.\" The app doesn\\'t work. I try to press \"enable notifications\" but it doesn\\'t work. I have them enabled through my settings and I have my Bluetooth and location on. Not sure what else to do. This Covid19 is trumped up. Northern Virginia has pools and restaurants open along with Virginia Beach, but not Richmond. Why? Do your research and read between the lines! When the cell phones all went down, they put a tracker on your phone and now an app for the same thing?? Do you really think the American people are that naive? Every major election some virus comes up. Zeka, Swine Flu, Covid19... the list goes on and on. Seems like the app stopped working in September. It says that\\'s the last time I\\'ve had a check for exposure... No notifications ever. Yet, I\\'ve found out via the media or exposed and positive testers when they mention it. VA needs to put in some additional work on the app. cannot enable notification. Always says internal error. Any solutions? After having a family member test positive and be quarantined to my house, very surprised that neither my wife or I received any notification from app regarding exposure. If a positive individual in my home for 10 days doesn\\'t trigger an alert, what does? Not sure why I was prompted to download an app that provides notifications for Virginia when I am way over on the west coast. Downloading one from Nevada I guess since it\\'s the closest I can find to Oregon. Seems like this system is fragmented and dysfunctional, as well intended as it may possibly see.. still. I\\'ll participate and play along until I\\'m otherwise inclined. Just the fact that you have to use Bluetooth at all times, immediately made me uninstall it. My battery life is horrible already, and it gets even worse when Bluetooth is on constantly. I would rather be in quarantine. Stop removing my post. This is nothing but spyware co-opted by government hoax scare covid. This has access to your phones front camera. If your phone is equipped with face recognition or iris scanner it will monitor and use it. Beware. Stop letting Dr. Scare you false positives. Covid is still a novel family virus--cold--rino--influenza! As a public health major, this is my feedback; The problem is, the app is only state level in Virginia. The App needs to be on a National level as people do travel to different states for vacations and business As far as I can see, not working. The tracker said there were only 3 checks and they were all from August 6..5 days ago when I downloaded it. This app requires full network access and grants the ability to view your network connections, neither of which can be disabled. This is the greatest HIPAA violation ever Unable to turn on notifications. Get internal error message Not very helpful and sends too many notifications on the same response every couple of minutes This App is a Virus it hijacks aspects of your phone and sends information without your knowledge or approval... nesides this thing only tells me once it is to late to do anything about it. this is like wearing a condom after sex. so whats the point? other than some company or goverment to collect information about where I go and what I do. With a majority of tests being false positives, this app is useless. The state of Virginia reports people who have never been tested as positive. Makes no sense, it wont track your location but it will tell you if you\\'ve come in contact with someone. Not buying that explanation! It caused my bluetooth to not work and now it won\\'t work again even thought I uninstalled it right away Great idea until you see the app requirements. Im not going to enable bluetooth so you can steal information from other peoples phones. Nice try china, but stick to tiktok. Interupts my service especially when I change Bluetooth devices. I have been trying for weeks to download this app but it will not work is there something wrong with it This App Takes your Meta Data and assigns it a number then takes your personel data location and history and reports it to the government ..DELETE -- It keeps crashing on start. I just installed and had no exposures How is this possible if my store that is very near me and that I go in almost daily has had two cases recently? Never could get it. Just searches and searches . Just wouldn\\'t install Wow makes you turn on bluetooth and is a complete invasion of privacy. Stay home and hide if you are scared of COVID This app is shoddy. Take precautions yourself which don\\'t involve getting tracked by the government with this mess. I hate this app it\\'s so scary what is nothing what what if something bad happened by covid 19 I don\\'t like this app at all I hate it ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? This mess don\\'t work it won\\'t even let me know if I\\'m in contact with someone You have to have Covid to enable the app so it\\'s not good if you don\\'t have Covid I hope your entire organization gets chlamydia. Then I\\'ll develop an app to track you. What is this all about? Is the flu going around? so what? This will just give false feeling of safety unless everyone is required to be tracked when found positive for covid... Like in China... Why their death rate is so low. There are 8.5 million people in Virginia. The android app says 100k+ downloads, Apple isn\\'t doing much better. That means, that there are about 8 million people not using this app which renders this useless. If you get a notification that you were in contact with someone who was infected, good chance you were in contact a few thousand times before this app detected it. It\\'s not the apps fault, it\\'s the fault of the states government for not advertising this across every channel possible. You had the right idea but the wrong b**** This app is for who tests positive use only. Worse than chinese app . Most of the positive reviews are bias VDH employees. Providing data such as current ACTIVE case you ones area would be helpful. App is not worth the money VA spent on it Gives internal error. Keep this trashy invasion of privacy off my screens What a waste of my tax dollars. Can\\'t turn it on. y it said internal error? Draining battery on phone Simply a dumb app... Va tax payers wasted for the development of this.... Government is fear mongering covid 19...... Tyranny at its finest... It\\'s all a ploy nice app bro-_- *I\\'m DON\\'T consent to this BULLSH1T* **STOP WITH THE ADS** You really expect people to voluntarily let you track them with relative medical information? The same people who rammed progressive laws in while we were in lock down, the same people who are ignoring real science and examples of successful strategy, all so you can try and hurt the president politically. Governor Blackface, take this app and shove it up your corrupt ass. NOT any mention of the App Name \"COVIDWISE\" for CNN national TV news coverage, mentioning it. You morons need to be fired as total worthless morons. Do you know what a PROPER NAME, is, and means, and it\\'s function and purpose is? TELL PEOPLE THE NAME OF THE APP to Search for and to get! You absolutely asinine idiots! Well ive had this on my phone for a while not sure if it works or not... Do you seriously think people who test positive are going to voluntarily install and report their results!! NO!! VDH will not even tell us which businesses and locations have a positive employee or patron, which by the way would be better to know!! Impossible to download. What Crock! Need a COVID Exposure app for West Virginia What a waste of tax dollars this is. Whomever wrote this app needs to find a real developer job. I don\\'t want a recommendation for this app. Thank you Let the government track you, just say yes. Communist China does it Is there an app like this one for MISSOURI so I won\\'t have to use a different one from a different state like Virginia They just wanna track your location go ahead dummies!! So this doesn\\'t help as long as you live in Virginia thanks for the waste of time I live in Oregon. This appears to be only for Virginia. Do have to live in Virginia to use this App? Did not have a version for my state. Does it only work in Virginia? Does this so only work in Virginia?? Never worked for me Hard to use I don\\'t have answer covid=fake af Malware possibilities ???? Not that good. Political parties killed 217,000 people both parties red and blue is going to kill you. Don\\'t trust use at all. China and U.S Are the blame for millions of deaths around the world shame on use. Give these little girls a shot that will not get them pregnant and bad parenting by mostly the parents that let there 12 to 17 year old gets Prego. Instead use bring Virus to kill people. If I were to do that or anybody else that is prison time. Hold the elephant and donkey accountable... Does not download (INSTALL) IN A TIMELY MANNER: NOT INSTALLED WITHIN 5 MTS. Garbage Garbage While I understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do, the app checking my location consistently at 1am, and 3am is crazy!

Also, why does each state have to develop their own app? If I travel, then other people in that other state won\\'t be compatible with this app. Right? Bluetooth? Makes no sense at all! Location services must be on for android devices to enable blue tooth, which is a huge drawback for me. I rarely have that turned on, and am selective as to when I have my cell radio on. It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don\\'t see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don\\'t see Google doing that though... I like the idea but not sure if it\\'s working on all Samsung devices correctly. I believe s9+ is shutting down due to \"Optimizing Battery Usage\". Need to shut this off or it won\\'t run in background to work. Need more information to consumers most probably don\\'t know. I\\'ve been using this for over 1 hour and still did not find any Pokemon. as to the app, it seems to draw down the battery. unfortunate not enough potential users, and the \"where - when\" for contacts seems seriously lacking. still have it running because it\\'s all that\\'s offered. The app is really good about not taking information, however, consistently enabling Bluetooth in a public space is a major opportunity for cybercriminals to hack devices, steal personal information, and wreak havoc. Bluetooth is too major of a threat vector for me to consider enabling this app. Great idea, poor execution. Doesn\\'t use location, but requires location services to be on to work. I leave mine off when not in use, because most other apps aren\\'t so privacy-conscious. By requiring GPS, this app creates security concerns that outweigh its benefits. While THIS app isn\\'t directly compromising my privacy, its permissions requirements open a privacy hole for OTHER apps to use. Android *doesn\\'t* require location for Bluetooth or BLE (I use both), but it unfortunately does for this app\\'s BLE tag tracking. I am trusting that this app doesn\\'t exploit my private information. I have read enough to be only mildly certain! Three stars because I just don\\'t know. I pray this is helpful to us all. Battery life plummeted for me since installing. Once uninstalled (yesterday) I really see a difference. Otherwise, app was simple and straightforward. It\\'s ridiculous that there are only state apps. I live in California and I don\\'t see an app for me. Also what about people who cross state lines? There needs to be a unified federal App, but I can\\'t see it happening. Difficult to understand the terminology, may often leave you scratching your head.

I\\'ve been using this for over 1 hour and still did not find any Pokemon. as to the app, it seems to draw down the battery. unfortunate not enough potential users, and the \"where - when\" for contacts seems seriously lacking. still have it running because it\\'s all that\\'s offered. I like the idea but not sure if it\\'s working on all Samsung devices correctly. I believe s9+ is shutting down due to \"Optimizing Battery Usage\". Need to shut this off or it won\\'t run in background to work. Need more information to consumers most probably don\\'t know. It\\'s ridiculous that there are only state apps. I live in California and I don\\'t see an app for me. Also what about people who cross state lines? There needs to be a unified federal App, but I can\\'t see it happening. I think yall should makw this app for arkansas tbh my state hasent made one and downloading this app and it using my location will it pickup exposure here in ark? Doesn\\'t use location, but requires location services to be on to work. I leave mine off when not in use, because most other apps aren\\'t so privacy-conscious. By requiring GPS, this app creates security concerns that outweigh its benefits. While THIS app isn\\'t directly compromising my privacy, its permissions requirements open a privacy hole for OTHER apps to use. Android *doesn\\'t* require location for Bluetooth or BLE (I use both), but it unfortunately does for this app\\'s BLE tag tracking. Difficult to understand the terminology, may often leave you scratching your head. The app is really good about not taking information, however, consistently enabling Bluetooth in a public space is a major opportunity for cybercriminals to hack devices, steal personal information, and wreak havoc. Bluetooth is too major of a threat vector for me to consider enabling this app. Great idea, poor execution. Battery life plummeted for me since installing. Once uninstalled (yesterday) I really see a difference. Otherwise, app was simple and straightforward. I am trusting that this app doesn\\'t exploit my private information. I have read enough to be only mildly certain! Three stars because I just don\\'t know. I pray this is helpful to us all. Just installed I appreciate the efforts to curb the spread of Covid. However when I turned off my phone\\'s location, I received a notification from Google\\'s Exposure Notifications framework that I needed to enable location in order for the app to work. What??? Covidwise says that \"No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app.\" I\\'ve since learned that while the app itself doesn\\'t ask for location, Google\\'s Exposure Notification framework (used by the app) obtains location data by using Bluetooth. This is very confusing. Please work out the kinks in messaging this. Otherwise it looks like the app is trying to do something sneaky (trying to gather and store my location data without telling me). For battery optimization issue, you can add this app in the \"whitelist\" so you won\\'t run into the issue. Unable to enable exposure notifications. I love the idea, would love to get full feature capabilities, but whenever I try to set up the app with exposure notifications, I\\'m getting an internal error message. Edit: The inability to enable exposure notifications is due to a limitation on my phone\\'s software version. The developer team was very responsive and helpful. I installed the app and it seems to work as advertised. The downsides of the app are two-fold. The app would appear to be geographically limited to VA and it depends on people with COVID to voluntarily install the app and report they have COVID in a timely manner. That said, even a 30% solution has merit and hopefully use of this system will be nationwide if not worldwide. I would definitely use this, except..... Except it is just for Virginia, and I\\'m in Illinois. But, I understand that a nation-wide method of linking among state departments of health is in the works. There is a really good article in the Washington Post about this app, and that\\'s where I found out about it. Hahaha! So funny thing, I just installed the app thinking this would work... No wonder it didn\\'t work! I never noticed this was an app made only for the state of Virginia! I\\'m in Florida where these cases are ????????????????... But it seems like an easy interface to use, and wish Florida could develop something like this. And even if they did, I would really hope people would give honest reports, but that may just be wishful thinking. I know my people, Floridians are crazy!?????????\\x80???\\x80??? Functions as advertised. Wished it showed a count of the number of phones mine interacted with and the count of positive cases being compared to my list. Would be five stars but It would be rad if the app didn\\'t send a weekly notification that notifications are on. I about soil myself Everytime. This app does NOT use nor require GPS & does NOT track you.Nor does it ask for GPS. Only as good as others with the app notifications turned on. This app will only be useful when a significant number of the 8.5 million Virginians have installed it. It doesn\\'t take up much space, so I\\'ve done my part at no cost. Seems like a wonderful idea, but I was just curious if this program would only work for V.A residents? Because I am about 20 minutes away from the border, but I live in WV. Would this also work for WV residents? Because if so I would love to share this around my community This is a great idea, but can the developers make it work on older model phones? I have friends who can\\'t use it because their phones won\\'t support it. Would like to know if this is helpful for west virginians as well as I do not see a app for wv. I see alot for different states just not wv. Let me know if I can use this. It\\'s amazing. I have the app even thou I\\'m in California. We need the app for California and all other states. Am I asking for to much? Lol. This covid is serious. Everyone needs this app So far so good. Will be nice piece of mind to know that if I happen to be exposed and not aware this may help notify me so we can help stop the spread. I will also be installing this on my kids phones too. Thank you VA!!! Easy to install I am a 57yr old working in a Covid 19 unit , what supplements to take every day to boost my immune system ? Will this work all over the country or just in Virginia? Helpful, gives me some peace of mind Larie 4 Yes fine more stuff like this thanks Okay Would like to know if this is helpful for west virginians as well as I do not see a app for wv.

Thank you VA!!! Update - I uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. However, please make more helpful error messages though. Older review - I get an \\'Internal Error, please try again\\' when I try to set Exposure Notifications (I have both bluetooth and Wifi enabled - using a Galaxy S10). Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it\\'s a \\'user error\\', phone configuration or something else out of my control. Does as stated. Does not send location or user info to google. Uses bluetooth to see if you came in range/contact with someone else that has the app and has been marked positive for covid. If you have within the 2 weeks you will get a notification. All info is stored on your phone. ????Needs to be nationwide in the U.S. Please download for yourself, if for no one else. Simple. Easy: to use, to understand how the technology works, & to navigate the app itself. Does *NOT* harvest ur data w/out ur knowledge &/or consent, sell your data, or spy on you or others. Uses Bluetooth. No sign up necessary. No login, no passwords, not asking for any permissions besides ???????? No location/GPS tracking. THANKS VA! If ur not in VA download this anyway, pls! Tell every1 u can irl & online ???? frequent traveller (planes) so am curious if this app talks to other joint apple / google framework covid trackers or does it just communicate with the va one ? if its all, then great job. if only va, then might want to work on that. Very well written app and it protects privacy. This should be a big help in slowing the spread of Covid-19. Thanks Virginia! It seems like it would be beneficial to be able to input negative tests as well. This app is brilliant and it\\'s sort of tragic how many people have no idea it exists. Thank you for making this. But it needs to be advertised more. I only heard about it through Twitter. Very good! And it can always tell me just in time! Reviews that are worried about privacy don\\'t understand how this app works. (There are apps out there that do spy on you by collecting everything you do, but this does not work that way.) It\\'s clear the design prioritized privacy. The app only needs access to Bluetooth. It\\'s a very clever idea. Glad to see Virginia getting this first. It\\'s easy to do your small part to get us out of this mess: wear your mask and get this app! The app Is well explained about how it works. The key is that it relies on self reporting if you test positive in order to alert others they my need to get tested. So in a sense, it\\'s like wearing a mask to protect others. I feel like reading some of the low reviews, I know who\\'s not wearing masks. I would hope that VDH is actively pushing people who test positive to install the app and report their case to build the database. Load it, use it, tell your friends! Good app. Privacy is protected. Clearly some reviewers have a reading comprehension problem: the app does not track you, it does not use GPS nor ask for it, and it does not know where you are. IF someone within BTLE range (a few meters) has tested positive and reported that to THEIR app, YOU get a notification that you are near them. That\\'s it. So the value to you depends on other people using the app and being honest about a positive test. It is a very good way to tell of you are possibly in contact with someone. The app is simple to use and I like that I can just set it and forget it. The app requires your Bluetooth to be on to work properly. With the extra functionality provided by Google, I\\'m glad they did not take the route of forcing Bluetooth to be on and instead just providing you a notification. The privacy policy is a breath of fresh air. I was happy to see a COVID tracing app that doesn\\'t take advantage of this unfortunate circumstance to collect and sell user data. Kudos to VDH for doing such a good job with this app. The app is lightweight and unobtrusive, and it was designed with privacy in mind. The app is easy to use; you just go through a short setup, and then it runs quietly in the background. Hopefully that\\'s the last you will ever hear of it. If you test positive, you can open up the app and report the test. If another app user that you were exposed to reports a positive test, you will get a notification, and then you know you need to go get tested. That\\'s all there is to it. I see that some reviewers are complaining that it requires GPS, but I\\'m not sure where they are getting that, since it is patently not true. You can see that much by just checking the app\\'s requested permissions from Android\\'s settings menu. It does, however, require Bluetooth to be turned on, since that\\'s how it detects the presence of other devices. TLDR: this app allows you to keep track of who you were exposed to while going out of its way to make sure that no record of either your movements or theirs is even created, let alone kept. If everyone uses it, then people who are exposed can self-isolate before they have a chance to pass the infection on, and that\\'s a way better way to contain the disease than shutting down civilization. Use it, and you might just save a life, maybe even your own. When was the last time you did that by installing an app? This is a very well made app! I\\'m a person who values my privacy very much, and this app is made in a way which respects that. It doesn\\'t record location. It give each phone an anonymous ID and uses Bluetooth (which only works ~20-30 feet) to tell which others IDs you were near. If any of those IDs report they have COVID, any othrt ID they were nearby within the past 2 weeks gets an alert. It does not track location or the owner of the phone, only the anonymous IDs This is a very well designed app that everyone should download. It doesn\\'t slow down your phone, it doesn\\'t take up much space, and it doesn\\'t track your location. It just identifies other phones with the app that you\\'ve come in contact with so you can be notified if any of them test positive. BUT it only works if almost everyone downloads the app. So download it. Let\\'s beat this thing! Dang, it\\'s pretty cool that this doesn\\'t even use location, just Bluetooth. I recommend reading about how this works, it\\'s actually really interesting. The app itself is super lightweight, just turn it on and it\\'ll take care of the rest automatically. Haven\\'t gotten any exposure notifications yet, thankfully! Guys... It uses Bluetooth LE to communicate with nearby devices, that\\'s why it doesn\\'t need location data. Your phone and another device exchange keys (which are randomized and deleted every 14 days) and if that user tests positive, they say so in the app which then notifies everyone their phone exchanged keys with. Please try to understand the technology here and that they\\'re trying to help instead of being conspiracy theorists thinking everyone is out to steal your data. Really happy to see the VDH releasing this app. It\\'s simple and does the job that needs doing, nothing negative to say about it. While this is coming months late, this app is something that everyone in VA needs to have on their device. Hopefully other states follow suit fast and develop a similar app so data can be shared between people nationwide, since the federal government can\\'t be bothered to help out in a pandemic. CovidWISE is the official contact tracing app for Virginia created by Apple and Google (collaboration). It is very well made and trustworthy. It does not use GPS and cannot track your location. It uses Bluetooth to simply detect when you\\'ve been near someone that also has the app installed (and their Bluetooth enabled at the time). If someone gets tested positive for covid that you\\'ve been near within the past 14 days, CovidWISE will alert you. It is all completely anonymous. Why a countrywide app was not developed and mandated (or at least offered) is beyond comprehension. This technology has proven itself in other countries. Somehow it has been left to individual states to adopt and only a few are agreeing to adopt it. Anyway, although I live in Florida...I installed Virginia\\'s app. At least if some Virginian who reports testing positive with COVID... had vacationed near me in Florida the prior 2 weeks... I will be notified. Here in Florida, we need all the help we can get. Now all I need is 49 more phones for each of all the other states? duh. Clever way to do anonymous proximity tracing by using Bluetooth instead of GPS. For those concerned about privacy... check the app permissions... it doesn\\'t require any access to your location or phone storage, etc. For those giving it a one star review and calling it \"stupid\"... just because you are too lazy to read about how it works doesn\\'t make the solution stupid. It just makes YOU seem stupid. Simple and easy to use, anonymous tokens connect through Bluetooth to determine contact history. Everything is voluntary and anonymous. You self report if you are ever tested positive, and then everyone who has been near you for 15 minutes is notified. I really appreciate this as a Lyft driver and hope everyone gets the app early to make it effective. This app looks AWESOME! Virginia, you guys are so lucky ro have a state to take it to such a brilliant level. Im sad we don\\'t have it in Ohio. It needs to be mandated on all phones through an update with all makes and models and all carriers & automatically turned on in EVERY STATE! it is safe, secure and helpful. Since it doesn\\'t infringe on personal data and doesn\\'t use the network, just bluetooth, (really just phone to phone) it\\'s a no brainer. Such a WASTED tool if not participating. This is such a terrific idea and app! I hope ALL Va residents will install and use this app! Not only am I immune compromised but so are 2 of my boys(ages 8&15)! This is such a relief to us, being able to instantly see if we\\'ve been in contact with someone who\\'s tested positive! There definitely needs to be more advertising regarding this app, as I just found out today by watching the governors news brief! Have the schools and hospitals send out notices! #doingourpart #flattenthecurve This is really well done! I\\'m pleasantly surprised since government apps are typically very clunky, but it appears they used the back end that Apple and Google set up well and didn\\'t overcomplicate things. I appreciate their approach with Bluetooth considering privacy compared to other approaches. If only other governments around the world were forward thinking enough to use this system! Great app! I\\'m in Australia and desperately hoping our Government drops their ridiculous app and builds one like this based on the Apple/Google Exposure Notification System. Virginians; you\\'re lucky to have this. Highly encourage you to use it! Incredibly useful and their privacy explanation offers an insight into how the app works. I\\'m glad that I don\\'t have to enable location services at all for this app, and it doesn\\'t seem to store any identifiable information on my device, for those concerned with privacy. The people who give poor reviews don\\'t understand the app or are fear mongering. Just like a mask, this app only works if everyone uses it. How the app works in a nutshell: you know when you scan for nearby Bluetooth devices and you see a bunch of devices? That\\'s what this app does. It scans for nearby Bluetooth, records any devices that are in range & *that have a copy of this app*. The app creates a low energy Bluetooth device broadcast ID that can be read only by other app users. Easy usage and I LOVED the aspect I was working about(not wanting to give my data usage to people buying it to get me to make purchases for things I don\\'t need) but not to worry bc they don\\'t sell your data or use it that way. you are safe . Privacy is always something I keep closely to me Amazing that it ONLY uses Bluetooth to identify your proximity to another person with the app. There is No tracking of your location or identify at all! Only downside is Virginia is full of conspiracy theorist who won\\'t download this app bc they think the government actually gives a sheet about what they searched on the internet last night Simple and direct. It\\'s your choice to submit the data or to leave on your Bluetooth. It doesn\\'t have any frills, such as other locations where exposure is possible, but for now, it seems like a good step in a healthy direction. Five stars until it turns out otherwise. A great concept, doesn\\'t use location data rather Bluetooth interactions in order to tell if you were near someone who submitted positive recently. I hope they continue to push for people to download it because otherwise it\\'ll be ineffective with the amount of people with it downloaded currently This app is brilliant. It uses the strength of an adjacent Bluetooth signal from someone having the same app and that self reported they tested positive. I just hope people who test positive decide to turn that key on. Let\\'s help our communities get back on track! Whether this app uses GPS or not for contact tracing, you should know in fact that you are likely already given an okay to most social media and devices for GPS as a way to have a better convenient lifestyle. Any app provided by health organizations that utilize some form of contact tracing is essential and can help save lives. Do yourself and many others a favor and download this app. And stop being so paranoid, worrying about your identity over livelihoods. Extremely useful app in today\\'s world. Privacy focused and uses Bluetooth only. It also explains itself in the app before you get started with it. A simple interface and just easy to use. Highly recommend it . Awesome app that protects privacy It\\'s neat how Virginia is the first state to use this new system. It\\'s very simple and easy to use, as it should be. Importantly, the system is private and doesn\\'t use personally identifiable info. It instead uses random keys and Bluetooth. The paranoid people who didn\\'t bother researching don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about. This kind of app only works well if a lot of people opt into it though, so please tell you friends and family about it. It\\'s for the common good. Quick and simple explanation: The app assigns you an ID the app will frequently send out a ping to see who\\'s around, the app doesn\\'t use or share your location. If it pings anyone around that test positive it will notify you. To keep yourself safe and others install the app. Great app let\\'s hope we can all get together and make this work. For all you people worried about the government tracking you if you have a cell phone you are trackable so not installing this app or any other is not going to make you safe from being tracked. Stay safe ???? Super easy to use. All I need to do is install it and keep Bluetooth running. Having a walk through on how to report would be nice, but there are really only 3 screens, so it\\'s pretty straightforward. Good app, not heavy, uses Bluetooth to detect other devices. Recommend reading about the app from the source rather than relying on the reviews, a lot of misinformation is in the reviews. Simple app. Does not track location or collect personal info. It just lings other phones via bluetooth who have stated they have had covid, have covid, or not. This helps you aee where you might have been exposed at but not by whom. The app is unobtrusive and does not have significant privacy issues but it needs to be widely used to be effective. Reading the critical reviews is discouraging. So much ignorance, misinformation and paranoia. Very easy to install, and I get periodic reminders that it\\'s doing its thing in the background. Other apps in my phone have more personal information than COVIDWISE does. A very good idea, obviously it\\'s not telling you \"Hey you have covid\", it\\'s saying \"Hey you might\\'ve been exposed to it, go get tested.\" If Northam is pushing it then you know it\\'s good Its doesn\\'t track you or use GPS nor does it require it. It works better the more people who download and use it. If someone is near it uses Bluetooth to detect it. I really appreciate this app sometimes there\\'s people that are infected with the virus or aids that think it\\'s not fair to them that try to infect others so that they can be miserable like them. I will definitely recommend this life saving app to ad many people as I can!!!! This app is a great idea and would work well if more people would use it. I wish cell phone providers would install it everyone\\'s phones so we could have effective contact tracing in this country. Be a responsible Virginian by downloading the app and telling your friends to download too. Great! Thank you for your App. Live in Virginia. Hope this helps flatten the curve. We\\'ve been hit hard here in Northern Virginia and can use the virus tracking. I both want to see a notification to see what it\\'s like and def don\\'t want to see a notification. Glad health care authorities are building apps like these. I\\'ve taken time to review the architecture and privacy of this app. Really glad that privacy was a focus. Now just need others to use this app. Fantastic tool to keep communities safe while still protecting their privacy and data. I work in data compliance and can vouch for this app. Easy to install. Requires no personal information or permissions. Great idea. Proud to support! Simple and easy to install and use. People giving it 1 star reviews clearly don\\'t understand the technology and just saying \"it makes no sense!\" Yes it does. I use this whenever I go to school or basically anywhere. It actually tells notifys me if someone recently been affected with COVID-19 and therefore I check this app and report it to my local school district or place. This app doesn\\'t track you any more than Facebook or Google maps already has been. It\\'s a good resource to have so you don\\'t end up accidentally mortally harming your loved ones or someone else\\'s loved one. No sign up required. No email, no personal info. Just install and click through the prompts and you\\'re all set up to get alerts. Thanks for taking the first step, Virginia! I would like to know why each state is developing their own app. Seems like the tech behind COVIDWISE can be used by any resident, Virginian or not. So why have 50 different solutions when one works? By all accounts no less invasive than using any social media, weather app, etc. And it will only work better the more it\\'s used. Simple to install and use, and it\\'s *here*. Now. Battery use on Sprint Samsung Note 10 Plus seems fine. App is easy to install and NOT intrusive. I\\'m disappointed it shows only 50K downloads. The more the merrier (or safer). Hopefully everyone installs and uses this. Important tool for contact tracing and controlling pandemic without having to go through another lockdown. DOESN\\'T use location or steal metadata. Don\\'t need covid to use. Very simple, easy install, one question to answer to make it work. Common sense. Sound concept, excellent implementation. If this is adopted widely, it could save many lives. I had to give zero personal data. Runs off of bluetooth. Great job on easy to use app. Easy to install and get stsrted. Sounds like it will be good to get alerts and possible contacts. Great app. Privacy well handled. Spread the word to your friends and family to install. Simple, clean and responsive app.. with complete privacy. And smart idea to use the BLE.. Easy peasy. Mask up, physical distance yourself from others. Great app for all states to use. Easy to download, easy to use, protects your privacy and can let you know if you\\'ve been exposed to COVID. 5 stars for the concept and clean/simple execution. Will need to update review based on real world use. Great app i feel very fortunate that i came across such a reliable app that i believe will save thousands. Wanna personal thank the state of Virgina for there hard work and dedication in formulating a dependable template for other states to emulate thanks again Simple, easy to use. It\\'d be nice to have a link to share on social media that you\\'ve signed up and encourage friends to do the same. This could really help slow the rise of Covid19 cases- it isn\\'t a tracker, just a notification app. All Virginians should use it! Great that we\\'re finally getting on contact tracing in the US. THIS APP DOESN\\'T USE LOCATION or share any of your accounts with VDH - it implements Google\\'s anonymous contact tracing API to track COVID exposure without tracking you personally. Very simple way to help with contact tracing, without sharing you locations or personal information If you don\\'t understand how the app works (spoiler alert: it\\'s not location tracking), it is speaking only to your lack of intelligence. Looks plenty user friendly, streamlined and simple. Mask up, VA! And if you\\'re anti-mask, please refer to the lyrics of Taylor Swifts\\' \\'Betty\\', at approximately 2:12 ???????? Great. Annoyances: can\\'t turn off weekly notifications, small battery life hit Glad to see our Virginia take a lead on this innovative app! Anything that helps suppress this devastating virus is a blessing. Looks simple and straightforward. No news is good news . No harm in this and hopefully it will help. We\\'ll see if it helps or not. Does not ask for any personal information, quick and easy to install No registration. No name needed. Uses encoded Bluetooth signals. Do your part. Save a life. Save your own life. So far so good. Its purpose is pretty straight forward, but I have no idea if anyone is using it around me. Would it be possible show proximity to any users that have this app active? No sign ups, no crazy permissions. No location data. Do your part and save lives. Very easy and simple to use, you forget it\\'s there. Installing this app is the easiest think to do in the fight against the virus. Encourage everyone you know to install it. Hopefully everyone will install this app. I wish it had been developed for deployment across all States rather than State by State which will take FOREVER too implement. Great job, please offer rapid testing through the app the increase engagement and cross talk between multi state agreement. Simple. No identifiers. Choose to report illness (why wouldn\\'t any decent person not). This kind of app has helped other counties fight this much better than we have. This is a positive step in helping to curb this virus. Set it and forget it is a huge plus. Feels good to be doing something to help stop the spread, and I appreciate that the developers are taking my data security and privacy seriously. App seems well designed and unobtrusive, Thank you VDH Essential app to keeping you safe during covid Apps like these are a no brainer for stopping and detecting transmission of viruses. Please learn how this app works before you give it a bad review. Nobody is trying to spy on you. We\\'re fighting a common enemy and this is a great tool to discover if you have been in proximity to someone who has tested positive. Fundamental problem: this app has almost no public outreach throughout Virginia. You don\\'t have to live in Virginia for the app to work! There are over 100 million downloads (I think that\\'s slightly above the population of Virginia), it\\'s just a company in Virginia who made the app. This definitely gives me more peace of mind if I\\'ve come into contact with it. The app is decent and easy to backdoor (reverse engineer) to see what is it doing. The reason why the nation can\\'t have 1 app...humm. Do you REALLY need an answer? Maybe because those dumb 1 star rating idiots are the ones that voted for the feckless national \"leader,\" but what can you expect from a man-child? Great job VDH!! Plus wear a mask! Thank you VDH! I would love to what I would do it I would do it I will download it????????????????????????????????????? M fu aiv Zbi Nice app Slaw Good Thanks Virginia! It seems like it would be beneficial to be able to input negative tests as well. So far so good That is very good ???? to let people no about that stuff going on around here Does as stated. Does not send location or user info to google. Uses bluetooth to see if you came in range/contact with someone else that has the app and has been marked positive for covid. If you have within the 2 weeks you will get a notification. All info is stored on your phone. This app is brilliant and it\\'s sort of tragic how many people have no idea it exists. ????Needs to be nationwide in the U.S. Please download for yourself, if for no one else. Simple. Easy: to use, to understand how the technology works, & to navigate the app itself. Does *NOT* harvest ur data w/out ur knowledge &/or consent, sell your data, or spy on you or others. Uses Bluetooth. No sign up necessary. No login, no passwords, not asking for any permissions besides ???????? No location/GPS tracking. THANKS VA! If ur not in VA download this anyway, pls! Tell every1 u can irl & online ???? It is a great app Very good! And it can always tell me just in time! Girls&Boys,club__hollywood.ipa en psychiatry.ArrivaDerci. Good Awesome it works. Thank you for making this. But it needs to be advertised more. I only heard about it through Twitter. Great! Thank you for your App. If everyone got this and actually used it this would be fantastic frequent traveller (planes) so am curious if this app talks to other joint apple / google framework covid trackers or does it just communicate with the va one ? if its all, then great job. if only va, then might want to work on that. Excellent to have. Awesome app that protects privacy Update - I uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. However, please make more helpful error messages though. Older review - I get an \\'Internal Error, please try again\\' when I try to set Exposure Notifications (I have both bluetooth and Wifi enabled - using a Galaxy S10). Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it\\'s a \\'user error\\', phone configuration or something else out of my control. ??????? Very well done. It is a very good way to tell of you are possibly in contact with someone. Very well written app and it protects privacy. This should be a big help in slowing the spread of Covid-19. Very easy to install, and I get periodic reminders that it\\'s doing its thing in the background. Other apps in my phone have more personal information than COVIDWISE does. It\\'s ok This is such a terrific idea and app! I hope ALL Va residents will install and use this app! Not only am I immune compromised but so are 2 of my boys(ages 8&15)! This is such a relief to us, being able to instantly see if we\\'ve been in contact with someone who\\'s tested positive! There definitely needs to be more advertising regarding this app, as I just found out today by watching the governors news brief! Have the schools and hospitals send out notices! #doingourpart #flattenthecurve Fundamental problem: this app has almost no public outreach throughout Virginia. It all bad be for the time being but ok for know Great. Annoyances: can\\'t turn off weekly notifications, small battery life hit Good app The more of us who participate, the better this works! I just saw the add on mid day news and they talked about this app that will pick up anyone you come in comtact that has covid19.Sweet !, Excellent Service I really appreciate this app sometimes there\\'s people that are infected with the virus or aids that think it\\'s not fair to them that try to infect others so that they can be miserable like them. I will definitely recommend this life saving app to ad many people as I can!!!! Hope this works in Missouri too! Great app design! Its ok It was great. Good Extremely useful app in today\\'s world. Privacy focused and uses Bluetooth only. It also explains itself in the app before you get started with it. A simple interface and just easy to use. Highly recommend it . This is really well done! I\\'m pleasantly surprised since government apps are typically very clunky, but it appears they used the back end that Apple and Google set up well and didn\\'t overcomplicate things. I appreciate their approach with Bluetooth considering privacy compared to other approaches. Good We are the tip of the spear here in VA???? Staying smart. Staying safe. This is a very well made app! I\\'m a person who values my privacy very much, and this app is made in a way which respects that. It doesn\\'t record location. It give each phone an anonymous ID and uses Bluetooth (which only works ~20-30 feet) to tell which others IDs you were near. If any of those IDs report they have COVID, any othrt ID they were nearby within the past 2 weeks gets an alert. It does not track location or the owner of the phone, only the anonymous IDs Centenary methodist church grace st richmond virginia This is a very well designed app that everyone should download. It doesn\\'t slow down your phone, it doesn\\'t take up much space, and it doesn\\'t track your location. It just identifies other phones with the app that you\\'ve come in contact with so you can be notified if any of them test positive. BUT it only works if almost everyone downloads the app. So download it. Let\\'s beat this thing! The app is unobtrusive and does not have significant privacy issues but it needs to be widely used to be effective. Reading the critical reviews is discouraging. So much ignorance, misinformation and paranoia. Whether this app uses GPS or not for contact tracing, you should know in fact that you are likely already given an okay to most social media and devices for GPS as a way to have a better convenient lifestyle. Any app provided by health organizations that utilize some form of contact tracing is essential and can help save lives. Do yourself and many others a favor and download this app. And stop being so paranoid, worrying about your identity over livelihoods. Glad health care authorities are building apps like these. I\\'ve taken time to review the architecture and privacy of this app. Really glad that privacy was a focus. Now just need others to use this app. I use this whenever I go to school or basically anywhere. It actually tells notifys me if someone recently been affected with COVID-19 and therefore I check this app and report it to my local school district or place. Fantastic tool to keep communities safe while still protecting their privacy and data. I work in data compliance and can vouch for this app. Wish all States would use this app need to develope for Delaware So far so good. Its purpose is pretty straight forward, but I have no idea if anyone is using it around me. Would it be possible show proximity to any users that have this app active? Very socially responsible, clearly written You don\\'t have to live in Virginia for the app to work! There are over 100 million downloads (I think that\\'s slightly above the population of Virginia), it\\'s just a company in Virginia who made the app. This definitely gives me more peace of mind if I\\'ve come into contact with it. The app is decent and easy to backdoor (reverse engineer) to see what is it doing. The reason why the nation can\\'t have 1 app...humm. Do you REALLY need an answer? Maybe because those dumb 1 star rating idiots are the ones that voted for the feckless national \"leader,\" but what can you expect from a man-child? Great job VDH!! Do the reviewers that are worried about privacy realize they\\'re using google now? You already sold your soul. By all accounts no less invasive than using any social media, weather app, etc. And it will only work better the more it\\'s used. Need this for Ohio Kudos to VDH for doing such a good job with this app. The app is lightweight and unobtrusive, and it was designed with privacy in mind. The app is easy to use; you just go through a short setup, and then it runs quietly in the background. Hopefully that\\'s the last you will ever hear of it. If you test positive, you can open up the app and report the test. If another app user that you were exposed to reports a positive test, you will get a notification, and then you know you need to go get tested. That\\'s all there is to it. I see that some reviewers are complaining that it requires GPS, but I\\'m not sure where they are getting that, since it is patently not true. You can see that much by just checking the app\\'s requested permissions from Android\\'s settings menu. It does, however, require Bluetooth to be turned on, since that\\'s how it detects the presence of other devices. TLDR: this app allows you to keep track of who you were exposed to while going out of its way to make sure that no record of either your movements or theirs is even created, let alone kept. If everyone uses it, then people who are exposed can self-isolate before they have a chance to pass the infection on, and that\\'s a way better way to contain the disease than shutting down civilization. Use it, and you might just save a life, maybe even your own. When was the last time you did that by installing an app? Want to see A lot of critical reviews are from people who don\\'t understand the technology behind how ENS works. The people who give poor reviews don\\'t understand the app or are fear mongering. Just like a mask, this app only works if everyone uses it. How the app works in a nutshell: you know when you scan for nearby Bluetooth devices and you see a bunch of devices? That\\'s what this app does. It scans for nearby Bluetooth, records any devices that are in range & *that have a copy of this app*. The app creates a low energy Bluetooth device broadcast ID that can be read only by other app users. Easy usage and I LOVED the aspect I was working about(not wanting to give my data usage to people buying it to get me to make purchases for things I don\\'t need) but not to worry bc they don\\'t sell your data or use it that way. you are safe . Privacy is always something I keep closely to me A nice initiative in fighting covid. Like the idea of BLE which is privacy sensitive. Hope it helps curbing covid 19. Live in Virginia. Hope this helps flatten the curve. We\\'ve been hit hard here in Northern Virginia and can use the virus tracking. I both want to see a notification to see what it\\'s like and def don\\'t want to see a notification. Just installed.. too early to say! I If your smart this is how we beat the virus Easy to download, easy to use, protects your privacy and can let you know if you\\'ve been exposed to COVID. App is easy to install and NOT intrusive. I\\'m disappointed it shows only 50K downloads. The more the merrier (or safer). Essential app to keeping you safe during covid This app is a great idea and would work well if more people would use it. I wish cell phone providers would install it everyone\\'s phones so we could have effective contact tracing in this country. Be a responsible Virginian by downloading the app and telling your friends to download too. I think this app is a great idea and hope that many more Virginia residents will use it. Great app. Privacy well handled. Spread the word to your friends and family to install. Good privacy-first approach. Great app i feel very fortunate that i came across such a reliable app that i believe will save thousands. Wanna personal thank the state of Virgina for there hard work and dedication in formulating a dependable template for other states to emulate thanks again Excelente Thrilled Doing my part. I\\'m all in on this app Very easy and simple to use, you forget it\\'s there. This app doesn\\'t track you any more than Facebook or Google maps already has been. It\\'s a good resource to have so you don\\'t end up accidentally mortally harming your loved ones or someone else\\'s loved one. Simple app. Does not track location or collect personal info. It just lings other phones via bluetooth who have stated they have had covid, have covid, or not. This helps you aee where you might have been exposed at but not by whom. Just briefly..does this work in Minnesota and elsewhere? Great that we\\'re finally getting on contact tracing in the US. THIS APP DOESN\\'T USE LOCATION or share any of your accounts with VDH - it implements Google\\'s anonymous contact tracing API to track COVID exposure without tracking you personally. URANIUM DETERGENT [ingles 21] NLP for neuro linguistic patterns learning:humans. -trillionare deficit. Thanks for taking the first step, Virginia! I would like to know why each state is developing their own app. Seems like the tech behind COVIDWISE can be used by any resident, Virginian or not. So why have 50 different solutions when one works? Reviews that are worried about privacy don\\'t understand how this app works. (There are apps out there that do spy on you by collecting everything you do, but this does not work that way.) It\\'s clear the design prioritized privacy. The app only needs access to Bluetooth. It\\'s a very clever idea. Glad to see Virginia getting this first. It\\'s easy to do your small part to get us out of this mess: wear your mask and get this app! I\\'m all in!! Good app, not heavy, uses Bluetooth to detect other devices. Recommend reading about the app from the source rather than relying on the reviews, a lot of misinformation is in the reviews. Set and forget. What could be easier? The easiest app you will ever use. Easy to use and safe for your privacy. We are in this together. Had it 24 hours so far and the state security forces haven\\'t knocked down my door. Seriously people, enough with the conspiracy theories and help protect your neighbor.      ']\n"

      "while i understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do the app checking my location consistently at 1am and 3am is crazy. it is not checking my location when i am actually out and about during the day. i will be deleting this as i find that for me it is worthless. based on reply let me correct that to exposure checks at 2am 3am 4am 5am do no good for me as thats when i m home asleep. those are the check times that have been reported to me. bluetooth has always had security issues. hackers can get into our phones via bluetooth. search google bluetooth unveils its latest security issue with no security solution on msn newsgizmodo 9102020. also bluetooth constantly searches draining batteries. i think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks then the vdh could use that to crossreference to see if any app users were around an app reported covid19 victim. does nt run daily or even weekly checks. have been in contact with the developers previously about this issue which so far can only be rectified by uninstalling then reinstalling. i am wondering if it stops checking forever even if you only briefly turn off bluetooth instead of ensuring that connection ca nt review this app when it does nt run. after installing on my pixel 4xl i try to run it and it says internal error please try again. subsequent retries are futile as i get the same error repeatedly. when i try to sign up for exposure notifications i keep receiving the following error message internal error please try again. the app does nt work. i try to press enable notifications but it does nt work. i have them enabled through my settings and i have my bluetooth and location on. not sure what else to do. this covid19 is trumped up. northern virginia has pools and restaurants open along with virginia beach but not richmond. why. do your research and read between the lines. when the cell phones all went down they put a tracker on your phone and now an app for the same thing. do you really think the american people are that naive. every major election some virus comes up. zeka swine flu covid19 the list goes on and on. seems like the app stopped working in september. it says that s the last time i ve had a check for exposure no notifications ever. yet i ve found out via the media or exposed and positive testers when they mention it. va needs to put in some additional work on the app. can not enable notification. always says internal error. any solutions. after having a family member test positive and be quarantined to my house very surprised that neither my wife or i received any notification from app regarding exposure. if a positive individual in my home for 10 days does nt trigger an alert what does. not sure why i was prompted to download an app that provides notifications for virginia when i am way over on the west coast. downloading one from nevada i guess since it s the closest i can find to oregon. seems like this system is fragmented and dysfunctional as well intended as it may possibly see still. i ll participate and play along until i m otherwise inclined. just the fact that you have to use bluetooth at all times immediately made me uninstall it. my battery life is horrible already and it gets even worse when bluetooth is on constantly. i would rather be in quarantine. stop removing my post. this is nothing but spyware coopted by government hoax scare covid. this has access to your phones front camera. if your phone is equipped with face recognition or iris scanner it will monitor and use it. beware. stop letting dr scare you false positives. covid is still a novel family virus cold rino influenza. as a public health major this is my feedback the problem is the app is only state level in virginia. the app needs to be on a national level as people do travel to different states for vacations and business as far as i can see not working. the tracker said there were only 3 checks and they were all from august 6 5 days ago when i downloaded it. this app requires full network access and grants the ability to view your network connections neither of which can be disabled. this is the greatest hipaa violation ever unable to turn on notifications. get internal error message not very helpful and sends too many notifications on the same response every couple of minutes this app is a virus it hijacks aspects of your phone and sends information without your knowledge or approval nesides this thing only tells me once it is to late to do anything about it. this is like wearing a condom after sex. so whats the point. other than some company or goverment to collect information about where i go and what i do. with a majority of tests being false positives this app is useless. the state of virginia reports people who have never been tested as positive. makes no sense it wont track your location but it will tell you if you ve come in contact with someone. not buying that explanation. it caused my bluetooth to not work and now it wo nt work again even thought i uninstalled it right away great idea until you see the app requirements. im not going to enable bluetooth so you can steal information from other peoples phones. nice try china but stick to tiktok. interupts my service especially when i change bluetooth devices. i have been trying for weeks to download this app but it will not work is there something wrong with it this app takes your meta data and assigns it a number then takes your personel data location and history and reports it to the government delete it keeps crashing on start. i just installed and had no exposures how is this possible if my store that is very near me and that i go in almost daily has had two cases recently. never could get it. just searches and searches. just would nt install wow makes you turn on bluetooth and is a complete invasion of privacy. stay home and hide if you are scared of covid this app is shoddy. take precautions yourself which do nt involve getting tracked by the government with this mess. i hate this app it s so scary what is nothing what what if something bad happened by covid 19 i do nt like this app at all i hate it. this mess do nt work it wo nt even let me know if i m in contact with someone you have to have covid to enable the app so it s not good if you do nt have covid i hope your entire organization gets chlamydia. then i ll develop an app to track you. what is this all about. is the flu going around. so what. this will just give false feeling of safety unless everyone is required to be tracked when found positive for covid like in china why their death rate is so low. there are 85 million people in virginia. the android app says 100k downloads apple is nt doing much better. that means that there are about 8 million people not using this app which renders this useless. if you get a notification that you were in contact with someone who was infected good chance you were in contact a few thousand times before this app detected it. it s not the apps fault it s the fault of the states government for not advertising this across every channel possible. you had the right idea but the wrong b this app is for who tests positive use only. worse than chinese app. most of the positive reviews are bias vdh employees. providing data such as current active case you ones area would be helpful. app is not worth the money va spent on it gives internal error. keep this trashy invasion of privacy off my screens what a waste of my tax dollars. ca nt turn it on. y it said internal error. draining battery on phone simply a dumb app va tax payers wasted for the development of this government is fear mongering covid 19 tyranny at its finest it s all a ploy nice app bro i m do nt consent to this bullsh1t stop with the ads you really expect people to voluntarily let you track them with relative medical information. the same people who rammed progressive laws in while we were in lock down the same people who are ignoring real science and examples of successful strategy all so you can try and hurt the president politically. governor blackface take this app and shove it up your corrupt ass. not any mention of the app name covidwise for cnn national tv news coverage mentioning it. you morons need to be fired as total worthless morons. do you know what a proper name is and means and it s function and purpose is. tell people the name of the app to search for and to get. you absolutely asinine idiots. well ive had this on my phone for a while not sure if it works or not do you seriously think people who test positive are going to voluntarily install and report their results. no. vdh will not even tell us which businesses and locations have a positive employee or patron which by the way would be better to know. impossible to download. what crock. need a covid exposure app for west virginia what a waste of tax dollars this is. whomever wrote this app needs to find a real developer job. i do nt want a recommendation for this app. thank you let the government track you just say yes. communist china does it is there an app like this one for missouri so i wo nt have to use a different one from a different state like virginia they just wan na track your location go ahead dummies. so this does nt help as long as you live in virginia thanks for the waste of time i live in oregon. this appears to be only for virginia. do have to live in virginia to use this app. did not have a version for my state. does it only work in virginia. does this so only work in virginia. never worked for me hard to use i do nt have answer covidfake af malware possibilities. not that good. political parties killed 217000 people both parties red and blue is going to kill you. do nt trust use at all. china and us are the blame for millions of deaths around the world shame on use. give these little girls a shot that will not get them pregnant and bad parenting by mostly the parents that let there 12 to 17 year old gets prego. instead use bring virus to kill people. if i were to do that or anybody else that is prison time. hold the elephant and

about 8 million people not using this app which renders this useless. if you get a notification that you were in contact with someone who was infected good chance you were in contact a few thousand times before this app detected it. it s not the apps fault it s the fault of the states government for not advertising this across every channel possible. does it only work in virginia. with a majority of tests being false positives this app is useless. the state of virginia reports people who have never been tested as positive. simply a dumb app va tax payers wasted for the development of this government is fear mongering covid 19 tyranny at its finest it s all a ploy do have to live in virginia to use this app. i live in oregon. this appears to be only for virginia. impossible to download. what crock. as far as i can see not working. the tracker said there were only 3 checks and they were all from august 6 5 days ago when i downloaded it. interupts my service especially when i change bluetooth devices. did not have a version for my state. so this does nt help as long as you live in virginia thanks for the waste of time this app is for who tests positive use only. worse than chinese app. is there an app like this one for missouri so i wo nt have to use a different one from a different state like virginia this app requires full network access and grants the ability to view your network connections neither of which can be disabled. this app is a virus it hijacks aspects of your phone and sends information without your knowledge or approval nesides this thing only tells me once it is to late to do anything about it. this is like wearing a condom after sex. so whats the point. other than some company or goverment to collect information about where i go and what i do. i just installed and had no exposures how is this possible if my store that is very near me and that i go in almost daily has had two cases recently. it caused my bluetooth to not work and now it wo nt work again even thought i uninstalled it right away you have to have covid to enable the app so it s not good if you do nt have covid makes no sense it wont track your location but it will tell you if you ve come in contact with someone. not buying that explanation. this app takes your meta data and assigns it a number then takes your personel data location and history and reports it to the government delete update month and a half after i installed the app and there are only 1 users across va time to uninstall it. anything that helps to fight covid gets 5 star and to those believing in looney tunes and conspiracy theories think about what you carry in your pocket cell phone or have on a shelf at home alexa. either you give your phone permission or not do you really think professional it person ca nt make a virus go around your blocked permissions. drains my battery too much to have bluetooth on all the time and i forget to turn it on the few times i m near people. i know they do nt record location but if there were a way to prompt me to turn bluetooth on when i change location that would be beneficial i was potentially exposed by my doc at a visit. the app is weak because reporting is optional. a good start. however in a few minutes my wife and i were able to be in the presence of a vegetable lady and 4 office coworkers in our local dem office. we duly called them alli felt like typhoid mary. john. my housemates i have all tested positive but we ca nt report it in the app because the health department has nt contacted any of us so there is no pin code. requires that gps location is always on to get notifications. i thought it just needed bluetooth. i do nt want my location data always getting sent to google. also why does each state have to develop their own app. if i travel then other people in that other state wo nt be compatible with this app. right. bluetooth required. i use bluetooth very selectivly. i wo nt use it 247 as it increases the chance of hacking bluejacking in other words. this app has stored almost 300 zip files in my one drive. why. and how. i never told it to store anything anywhere ca nt figure out how to make it stop. i m uninstalling it because i pay for my one drive storage do nt want your app stealing my space. i now have to delete almost 300 files from my drive. it is fine but when i try to turn on exposure notifications it says en error occurred fix it after installing i noticed it was intended for the state of virginia. not sure now if anyone can use the app in other states or locations. can the developer comment on this please. bj7 liu yo ugh m7o i y9 66 yikes it ibm o it iy8mnb 667 8 7   6  7 5  . 7  9 7 7 yup no it y i y4 8th until yw 7o it b 9 it. 86 it iv 6 it 6y6 h 8vv it

error message. edit the inability to enable exposure notifications is due to a limitation on my phone s software version. the developer team was very responsive and helpful. i installed the app and it seems to work as advertised. the downsides of the app are twofold. the app would appear to be geographically limited to va and it depends on people with covid to voluntarily install the app and report they have covid in a timely manner. that said even a 30 solution has merit and hopefully use of this system will be nationwide if not worldwide. i would definitely use this except except it is just for virginia and i m in illinois. but i understand that a nationwide method of linking among state departments of health is in the works. there is a really good article in the washington post about this app and that s where i found out about it. hahaha. so funny thing i just installed the app thinking this would work no wonder it did nt work. i never noticed this was an app made only for the state of virginia. i m in florida where these cases are. but it seems like an easy interface to use and wish florida could develop something like this. and even if they did i would really hope people would give honest reports but that may just be wishful thinking. i know my people floridians are crazy  . functions as advertised. wished it showed a count of the number of phones mine interacted with and the count of positive cases being compared to my list. would be five stars but it would be rad if the app did nt send a weekly notification that notifications are on. i about soil myself everytime. this app does not use nor require gps does not track younor does it ask for gps. only as good as others with the app notifications turned on. this app will only be useful when a significant number of the 85 million virginians have installed it. it does nt take up much space so i ve done my part at no cost. seems like a wonderful idea but i was just curious if this program would only work for va residents. because i am about 20 minutes away from the border but i live in wv. would this also work for wv residents. because if so i would love to share this around my community this is a great idea but can the developers make it work on older model phones. i have friends who ca nt use it because their phones wo nt support it. would like to know if this is helpful for west virginians as well as i do not see a app for wv. i see alot for different states just not wv. let me know if i can use this. it s amazing. i have the app even thou i m in california. we need the app for california and all other states. am i asking for to much. lol. this covid is serious. everyone needs this app so far so good. will be nice piece of mind to know that if i happen to be exposed and not aware this may help notify me so we can help stop the spread. i will also be installing this on my kids phones too. thank you va. easy to install i am a 57yr old working in a covid 19 unit what supplements to take every day to boost my immune system. will this work all over the country or just in virginia. helpful gives me some peace of mind larie 4 yes fine more stuff like this thanks okay

update i uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. however please make more helpful error messages though. older review i get an internal error please try again when i try to set exposure notifications i have both bluetooth and wifi enabled using a galaxy s10. please fix or give a more helpful error message so i can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is whether it s a user error phone configuration or something else out of my control. does as stated. does not send location or user info to google. uses bluetooth to see if you came in rangecontact with someone else that has the app and has been marked positive for covid. if you have within the 2 weeks you will get a notification. all info is stored on your phone. . needs to be nationwide in the us please download for yourself if for no one else. simple. easy to use to understand how the technology works to navigate the app itself. does not harvest ur data wout ur knowledge or consent sell your data or spy on you or others. uses bluetooth. no sign up necessary. no login no passwords not asking for any permissions besides. no locationgps tracking. thanks va. if ur not in va download this anyway pls. tell every1 u can irl online. frequent traveller planes so am curious if this app talks to other joint apple google framework covid trackers or does it just communicate with the va one. if its all then great job. if only va then might want to work on that. very well written app and it protects privacy. this should be a big help in slowing the spread of covid19. thanks virginia. it seems like it would be beneficial to be able to input negative tests as well. this app is brilliant and it s sort of tragic how many people have no idea it exists. thank you for making this. but it needs to be advertised more. i only heard about it through twitter. very good. and it can always tell me just in time. reviews that are worried about privacy do nt understand how this app works. there are apps out there that do spy on you by collecting everything you do but this does not work that way. it s clear the design prioritized privacy. the app only needs access to bluetooth. it s a very clever idea. glad to see virginia getting this first. it s easy to do your small part to get us out of this mess wear your mask and get this app. the app is well explained about how it works. the key is that it relies on self reporting if you test positive in order to alert others they my need to get tested. so in a sense it s like wearing a mask to protect others. i feel like reading some of the low reviews i know who s not wearing masks. i would hope that vdh is actively pushing people who test positive to install the app and report their case to build the database. load it use it tell your friends. good app. privacy is protected. clearly some reviewers have a reading comprehension problem the app does not track you it does not use gps nor ask for it and it does not know where you are. if someone within btle range a few meters has tested positive and reported that to their app you get a notification that you are near them. that s it. so the value to you depends on other people using the app and being honest about a positive test. it is a very good way to tell of you are possibly in contact with someone. the app is simple to use and i like that i can just set it and forget it. the app requires your bluetooth to be on to work properly. with the extra functionality provided by google i m glad they did not take the route of forcing bluetooth to be on and instead just providing you a notification. the privacy policy is a breath of fresh air. i was happy to see a covid tracing app that does nt take advantage of this unfortunate circumstance to collect and sell user data. kudos to vdh for doing such a good job with this app. the app is lightweight and unobtrusive and it was designed with privacy in mind. the app is easy to use you just go through a short setup and then it runs quietly in the background. hopefully that s the last you will ever hear of it. if you test positive you can open up the app and report the test. if another app user that you were exposed to reports a positive test you will get a notification and then you know you need to go get tested. that s all there is to it. i see that some reviewers are complaining that it requires gps but i m not sure where they are getting that since it is patently not true. you can see that much by just checking the app s requested permissions from android s settings menu. it does however require bluetooth to be turned on since that s how it detects the presence of other devices. tldr this app allows you to keep track of who you were exposed to while going out of its way to make sure that no record of either your movements or theirs is even created let alone kept. if everyone uses it then people who are exposed can selfisolate before they have a chance to pass the infection on and that s a way better way to contain the disease than shutting down civilization. use it and you might just save a life maybe even your own. when was the last time you did that by installing an app. this is a very well made app. i m a person who values my privacy very much and this app is made in a way which respects that. it does nt record location. it give each phone an anonymous id and uses bluetooth which only works 2030 feet to tell which others ids you were near. if any of those ids report they have covid any othrt id they were nearby within the past 2 weeks gets an alert. it does not track location or the owner of the phone only the anonymous ids this is a very well designed app that everyone should download. it does nt slow down your phone it does nt take up much space and it does nt track your location. it just identifies other phones with the app that you ve come in contact with so you can be notified if any of them test positive. but it only works if almost everyone downloads the app. so download it. let s beat this thing. dang it s pretty cool that this does nt even use location just bluetooth. i recommend reading about how this works it s actually really interesting. the app itself is super lightweight just turn it on and it ll take care of the rest automatically. have nt gotten any exposure notifications yet thankfully. guys it uses bluetooth le to communicate with nearby devices that s why it does nt need location data. your phone and another device exchange keys which are randomized and deleted every 14 days and if that user tests positive they say so in the app which then notifies everyone their phone exchanged keys with. please try to understand the technology here and that they re trying to help instead of being conspiracy theorists thinking everyone is out to steal your data. really happy to see the vdh releasing this app. it s simple and does the job that needs doing nothing negative to say about it. while this is coming months late this app is something that everyone in va needs to have on their device. hopefully other states follow suit fast and develop a similar app so data can be shared between people nationwide since the federal government ca nt be bothered to help out in a pandemic. covidwise is the official contact tracing app for virginia created by apple and google collaboration. it is very well made and trustworthy. it does not use gps and can not track your location. it uses bluetooth to simply detect when you ve been near someone that also has the app installed and their bluetooth enabled at the time. if someone gets tested positive for covid that you ve been near within the past 14 days covidwise will alert you. it is all completely anonymous. why a countrywide app was not developed and mandated or at least offered is beyond comprehension. this technology has proven itself in other countries. somehow it has been left to individual states to adopt and only a few are agreeing to adopt it. anyway although i live in florida i installed virginia s app. at least if some virginian who reports testing positive with covid had vacationed near me in florida the prior 2 weeks i will be notified. here in florida we need all the help we can get. now all i need is 49 more phones for each of all the other states. duh. clever way to do anonymous proximity tracing by using bluetooth instead of gps. for those concerned about privacy check the app permissions it does nt require any access to your location or phone storage etc. for those giving it a one star review and calling it stupid just because you are too lazy to read about how it works does nt make the solution stupid. it just makes you seem stupid. simple and easy to use anonymous tokens connect through bluetooth to determine contact history. everything is voluntary and anonymous. you self report if you are ever tested positive and then everyone who has been near you for 15 minutes is notified. i really appreciate this as a lyft driver and hope everyone gets the app early to make it effective. this app looks awesome. virginia you guys are so lucky ro have a state to take it to such a brilliant level. im sad we do nt have it in ohio. it needs to be mandated on all phones through an update with all makes and models and all carriers automatically turned on in every state. it is safe secure and helpful. since it does nt infringe on personal data and does nt use the network just bluetooth really just phone to phone it s a no brainer. such a wasted tool if not participating. this is such a terrific idea and app. i hope all va residents will install and use this app. not only am i immune compromised but so are 2 of my boys ages 8 15. this is such a relief to us being able to instantly see if we ve been in contact with someone who s tested positive. there definitely needs to be more advertising regarding this app as i just found out today by watching the governors news brief. have the schools and hospitals send out notices. doingourpart flattenthecurve this is really well done. i m pleasantly surprised since government apps are typically very clunky but it appears they used the back end that apple and google set up well and did nt overcomplicate things. i appreciate their approach with bluetooth considering privacy compared to other approaches. if only other governments around the world were forward thinking enough to use this system. great app. i m in australia and desperately hoping our government drops their ridiculous app and builds one like this based on the applegoogle exposure notification system. virginians you re lucky to have this. highly encourage you to use it. incredibly useful and their privacy explanation offers an insight into how the app works. i m glad that i do nt have to enable location services at all for this app and it does nt seem to store any identifiable information on my device for those concerned with privacy. the people who give poor reviews do nt understand the app or are fear mongering. just like a mask this app only works if everyone uses it. how the app works in a nutshell you know when you scan for nearby bluetooth devices and you see a bunch of devices. that s what this app does. it scans for nearby bluetooth records any devices that are in range that have a copy of this app. the app creates a low energy bluetooth device broadcast id that can be read only by other app users. easy usage and i loved the aspect i was working about not wanting to give my data usage to people buying it to get me to make purchases for things i do nt need but not to worry bc they do nt sell your data or use it that way. you are safe. privacy is always something i keep closely to me amazing that it only uses bluetooth to identify your proximity to another person with the app. there is no tracking of your location or identify at all. only downside is virginia is full of conspiracy theorist who wo nt download this app bc they think the government actually gives a sheet about what they searched on the internet last night simple and direct. it s your choice to submit the data or to leave on your bluetooth. it does nt have any frills such as other locations where exposure is possible but for now it seems like a good step in a healthy direction. five stars until it turns out otherwise. a great concept does nt use location data rather bluetooth interactions in order to tell if you were near someone who submitted positive recently. i hope they continue to push for people to download it because otherwise it ll be ineffective with the amount of people with it downloaded currently this app is brilliant. it uses the strength of an adjacent bluetooth signal from someone having the same app and that self reported they tested positive. i just hope people who test positive decide to turn that key on. let s help our communities get back on track. whether this app uses gps or not for contact tracing you should know in fact that you are likely already given an okay to most social media and devices for gps as a way to have a better convenient lifestyle. any app provided by health organizations that utilize some form of contact tracing is essential and can help save lives. do yourself and many others a favor and download this app. and stop being so paranoid worrying about your identity over livelihoods. extremely useful app in today s world. privacy focused and uses bluetooth only. it also explains itself in the app before you get started with it. a simple interface and just easy to use. highly recommend it. awesome app that protects privacy it s neat how virginia is the first state to use this new system. it s very simple and easy to use as it should be. importantly the system is private and does nt use personally identifiable info. it instead uses random keys and bluetooth. the paranoid people who did nt bother researching do nt know what they re talking about. this kind of app only works well if a lot of people opt into it though so please tell you friends and family about it. it s for the common good. quick and simple explanation the app assigns you an id the app will frequently send out a ping to see who s around the app does nt use or share your location. if it pings anyone around that test positive it will notify you. to keep yourself safe and others install the app. great app let s hope we can all get together and make this work. for all you people worried about the government tracking you if you have a cell phone you are trackable so not installing this app or any other is not going to make you safe from being tracked. stay safe. super easy to use. all i need to do is install it and keep bluetooth running. having a walk through on how to report would be nice but there are really only 3 screens so it s pretty straightforward. good app not heavy uses bluetooth to detect other devices. recommend reading about the app from the source rather than relying on the reviews a lot of misinformation is in the reviews. simple app. does not track location or collect personal info. it just lings other phones via bluetooth who have stated they have had covid have covid or not. this helps you aee where you might have been exposed at but not by whom. the app is unobtrusive and does not have significant privacy issues but it needs to be widely used to be effective. reading the critical reviews is discouraging. so much ignorance misinformation and paranoia. very easy to install and i get periodic reminders that it s doing its thing in the background. other apps in my phone have more personal information than covidwise does. a very good idea obviously it s not telling you hey you have covid it s saying hey you might ve been exposed to it go get tested. if northam is pushing it then you know it s good its does nt track you or use gps nor does it require it. it works better the more people who download and use it. if someone is near it uses bluetooth to detect it. i really appreciate this app sometimes there s people that are infected with the virus or aids that think it s not fair to them that try to infect others so that they can be miserable like them. i will definitely recommend this life saving app to ad many people as i can. this app is a great idea and would work well if more people would use it. i wish cell phone providers would install it everyone s phones so we could have effective contact tracing in this country. be a responsible virginian by downloading the app and telling your friends to download too. great. thank you for your app. live in virginia. hope this helps flatten the curve. we ve been hit hard here in northern virginia and can use the virus tracking. i both want to see a notification to see what it s like and def do nt want to see a notification. glad health care authorities are building apps like these. i ve taken time to review the architecture and privacy of this app. really glad that privacy was a focus. now just need others to use this app. fantastic tool to keep communities safe while still protecting their privacy and data. i work in data compliance and can vouch for this app. easy to install. requires no personal information or permissions. great idea. proud to support. simple and easy to install and use. people giving it 1 star reviews clearly do nt understand the technology and just saying it makes no sense. yes it does. i use this whenever i go to school or basically anywhere. it actually tells notifys me if someone recently been affected with covid19 and therefore i check this app and report it to my local school district or place. this app does nt track you any more than facebook or google maps already has been. it s a good resource to have so you do nt end up accidentally mortally harming your loved ones or someone else s loved one. no sign up required. no email no personal info. just install and click through the prompts and you re all set up to get alerts. thanks for taking the first step virginia. i would like to know why each state is developing their own app. seems like the tech behind covidwise can be used by any resident virginian or not. so why have 50 different solutions when one works. by all accounts no less invasive than using any social media weather app etc. and it will only work better the more it s used. simple to install and use and it s here. now. battery use on sprint samsung note 10 plus seems fine. app is easy to install and not intrusive. i m disappointed it shows only 50k downloads. the more the merrier or safer. hopefully everyone installs and uses this. important tool for contact tracing and controlling pandemic without having to go through another lockdown. does nt use location or steal metadata. do nt need covid to use. very simple easy install one question to answer to make it work. common sense. sound concept excellent implementation. if this is adopted widely it could save many lives. i had to give zero personal data. runs off of bluetooth. great job on easy to use app. easy to install and get stsrted. sounds like it will be good to get alerts and possible contacts. great app. privacy well handled. spread the word to your friends and family to install. simple clean and responsive app with complete privacy. and smart idea to use the ble easy peasy. mask up physical distance yourself from others. great app for all states to use. easy to download easy to use protects your privacy and can let you know if you ve been exposed to covid. 5 stars for the concept and cleansimple execution. will need to update review based on real world use. great app i feel very fortunate that i came across such a reliable app that i believe will save thousands. wan na personal thank the state of virgina for there hard work and dedication in formulating a dependable template for other states to emulate thanks again simple easy to use. it d be nice to have a link to share on social media that you ve signed up and encourage friends to do the same. this could really help slow the rise of covid19 cases it is nt a tracker just a notification app. all virginians should use it. great that we re finally getting on contact tracing in the us. this app does nt use location or share any of your accounts with vdh it implements google s anonymous contact tracing api to track covid exposure without tracking you personally. very simple way to help with contact tracing without sharing you locations or personal information if you do nt understand how the app works spoiler alert it s not location tracking it is speaking only to your lack of intelligence. looks plenty user friendly streamlined and simple. mask up va. and if you re antimask please refer to the lyrics of taylor swifts betty at approximately 212. great. annoyances ca nt turn off weekly notifications small battery life hit glad to see our virginia take a lead on this innovative app. anything that helps suppress this devastating virus is a blessing. looks simple and straightforward. no news is good news. no harm in this and hopefully it will help. we ll see if it helps or not. does not ask for any personal information quick and easy to install no registration. no name needed. uses encoded bluetooth signals. do your part. save a life. save your own life. so far so good. its purpose is pretty straight forward but i have no idea if anyone is using it around me. would it be possible show proximity to any users that have this app active. no sign ups no crazy permissions. no location data. do your part and save lives. very easy and simple to use you forget it s there. installing this app is the easiest think to do in the fight against the virus. encourage everyone you know to install it. hopefully everyone will install this app. i wish it had been developed for deployment across all states rather than state by state which will take forever too implement. great job please offer rapid testing through the app the increase engagement and cross talk between multi state agreement. simple. no identifiers. choose to report illness why would nt any decent person not. this kind of app has helped other counties fight this much better than we have. this is a positive step in helping to curb this virus. set it and forget it is a huge plus. feels good to be doing something to help stop the spread and i appreciate that the developers are taking my data security and privacy seriously. app seems well designed and unobtrusive thank you vdh essential app to keeping you safe during covid apps like these are a no brainer for stopping and detecting transmission of viruses. please learn how this app works before you give it a bad review. nobody is trying to spy on you. we re fighting a common enemy and this is a great tool to discover if you have been in proximity to someone who has tested positive. fundamental problem this app has almost no public outreach throughout virginia. you do nt have to live in virginia for the app to work. there are over 100 million downloads i think that s slightly above the population of virginia it s just a company in virginia who made the app. this definitely gives me more peace of mind if i ve come into contact with it. the app is decent and easy to backdoor reverse engineer to see what is it doing. the reason why the nation ca nt have 1 app humm. do you really need an answer. maybe because those dumb 1 star rating idiots are the ones that voted for the feckless national leader but what can you expect from a manchild. great job vdh. plus wear a mask. thank you vdh. i would love to what i would do it i would do it i will download it. m fu aiv zbi nice app slaw good thanks virginia. it seems like it would be beneficial to be able to input negative tests as well. so far so good that is very good. to let people no about that stuff going on around here does as stated. does not send location or user info to google. uses bluetooth to see if you came in rangecontact with someone else that has the app and has been marked positive for covid. if you have within the 2 weeks you will get a notification. all info is stored on your phone. this app is brilliant and it s sort of tragic how many people have no idea it exists. . needs to be nationwide in the us please download for yourself if for no one else. simple. easy to use to understand how the technology works to navigate the app itself. does not harvest ur data wout ur knowledge or consent sell your data or spy on you or others. uses bluetooth. no sign up necessary. no login no passwords not asking for any permissions besides. no locationgps tracking. thanks va. if ur not in va download this anyway pls. tell every1 u can irl online. it is a great app very good. and it can always tell me just in time. girls boys clubhollywoodipa en psychiatryarrivaderci. good awesome it works. thank you for making this. but it needs to be advertised more. i only heard about it through twitter. great. thank you for your app. if everyone got this and actually used it this would be fantastic frequent traveller planes so am curious if this app talks to other joint apple google framework covid trackers or does it just communicate with the va one. if its all then great job. if only va then might want to work on that. excellent to have. awesome app that protects privacy update i uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. however please make more helpful error messages though. older review i get an internal error please try again when i try to set exposure notifications i have both bluetooth and wifi enabled using a galaxy s10. please fix or give a more helpful error message so i can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is whether it s a user error phone configuration or something else out of my control. . very well done. it is a very good way to tell of you are possibly in contact with someone. very well written app and it protects privacy. this should be a big help in slowing the spread of covid19. very easy to install and i get periodic reminders that it s doing its thing in the background. other apps in my phone have more personal information than covidwise does. it s ok this is such a terrific idea and app. i hope all va residents will install and use this app. not only am i immune compromised but so are 2 of my boys ages 8 15. this is such a relief to us being able to instantly see if we ve been in contact with someone who s tested positive. there definitely needs to be more advertising regarding this app as i just found out today by watching the governors news brief. have the schools and hospitals send out notices. doingourpart flattenthecurve fundamental problem this app has almost no public outreach throughout virginia. it all bad be for the time being but ok for know great. annoyances ca nt turn off weekly notifications small battery life hit good app the more of us who participate the better this works. i just saw the add on mid day news and they talked about this app that will pick up anyone you come in comtact that has covid19sweet excellent service i really appreciate this app sometimes there s people that are infected with the virus or aids that think it s not fair to them that try to infect others so that they can be miserable like them. i will definitely recommend this life saving app to ad many people as i can. hope this works in missouri too. great app design. its ok it was great. good extremely useful app in today s world. privacy focused and uses bluetooth only. it also explains itself in the app before you get started with it. a simple interface and just easy to use. highly recommend it. this is really well done. i m pleasantly surprised since government apps are typically very clunky but it appears they used the back end that apple and google set up well and did nt overcomplicate things. i appreciate their approach with bluetooth considering privacy compared to other approaches. good we are the tip of the spear here in va. staying smart. staying safe. this is a very well made app. i m a person who values my privacy very much and this app is made in a way which respects that. it does nt record location. it give each phone an anonymous id and uses bluetooth which only works 2030 feet to tell which others ids you were near. if any of those ids report they have covid any othrt id they were nearby within the past 2 weeks gets an alert. it does not track location or the owner of the phone only the anonymous ids centenary methodist church grace st richmond virginia this is a very well designed app that everyone should download. it does nt slow down your phone it does nt take up much space and it does nt track your location. it just identifies other phones with the app that you ve come in contact with so you can be notified if any of them test positive. but it only works if almost everyone downloads the app. so download it. let s beat this thing. the app is unobtrusive and does not have significant privacy issues but it needs to be widely used to be effective. reading the critical reviews is discouraging. so much ignorance misinformation and paranoia. whether this app uses gps or not for contact tracing you should know in fact that you are likely already given an okay to most social media and devices for gps as a way to have a better convenient lifestyle. any app provided by health organizations that utilize some form of contact tracing is essential and can help save lives. do yourself and many others a favor and download this app. and stop

compliance and can vouch for this app. wish all states would use this app need to develope for delaware so far so good. its purpose is pretty straight forward but i have no idea if anyone is using it around me. would it be possible show proximity to any users that have this app active. very socially responsible clearly written you do nt have to live in virginia for the app to work. there are over 100 million downloads i think that s slightly above the population of virginia it s just a company in virginia who made the app. this definitely gives me more peace of mind if i ve come into contact with it. the app is decent and easy to backdoor reverse engineer to see what is it doing. the reason why the nation ca nt have 1 app humm. do you really need an answer. maybe because those dumb 1 star rating idiots are the ones that voted for the feckless national leader but what can you expect from a manchild. great job vdh. do the reviewers that are worried about privacy realize they re using google now. you already sold your soul. by all accounts no less invasive than using any social media weather app etc. and it will only work better the more it s used. need this for ohio kudos to vdh for doing such a good job with this app. the app is lightweight and unobtrusive and it was designed with privacy in mind. the app is easy to use you just go through a short setup and then it runs quietly in the background. hopefully that s the last you will ever hear of it. if you test positive you can open up the app and report the test. if another app user that you were exposed to reports a positive test you will get a notification and then you know you need to go get tested. that s all there is to it. i see that some reviewers are complaining that it requires gps but i m not sure where they are getting that since it is patently not true. you can see that much by just checking the app s requested permissions from android s settings menu. it does however require bluetooth to be turned on since that s how it detects the presence of other devices. tldr this app allows you to keep track of who you were exposed to while going out of its way to make sure that no record of either your movements or theirs is even created let alone kept. if everyone uses it then people who are exposed can selfisolate before they have a chance to pass the infection on and that s a way better way to contain the disease than shutting down civilization. use it and you might just save a life maybe even your own. when was the last time you did that by installing an app. want to see a lot of critical reviews are from people who do nt understand the technology behind how ens works. the people who give poor reviews do nt understand the app or are fear mongering. just like a mask this app only works if everyone uses it. how the app works in a nutshell you know when you scan for nearby bluetooth devices and you see a bunch of devices. that s what this app does. it scans for nearby bluetooth records any devices that are in range that have a copy of this app. the app creates a low energy bluetooth device broadcast id that can be read only by other app users. easy usage and i loved the aspect i was working about not wanting to give my data usage to people buying it to get me to make purchases for things i do nt need but not to worry bc they do nt sell your data or use it that way. you are safe. privacy is always something i keep closely to me a nice initiative in fighting covid. like the idea of ble which is privacy sensitive. hope it helps curbing covid 19 live in virginia. hope this helps flatten the curve. we ve been hit hard here in northern virginia and can use the virus tracking. i both want to see a notification to see what it s like and def do nt want to see a notification. just installed too early to say. i if your smart this is how we beat the virus easy to download easy to use protects your privacy and can let you know if you ve been exposed to covid. app is easy to install and not intrusive. i m disappointed it shows only 50k downloads. the more the merrier or safer. essential app to keeping you safe during covid this app is a great idea and would work well if more people would use it. i wish cell phone providers would install it everyone s phones so we could have effective contact tracing in this country. be a responsible virginian by downloading the app and telling your friends to download too. i think this app is a great idea and hope that many more virginia residents will use it. great app. privacy well handled. spread the word to your friends and family to install. good privacyfirst approach. great app i feel very fortunate that i came across such a reliable app that i believe will save thousands. wan na personal thank the state of virgina for there hard work and dedication in formulating a dependable template for other states to emulate thanks again excelente thrilled doing my part. i m all in on this app very easy and simple to use you forget it s there. this app does nt track you any more than facebook or google maps already has been. it s a good resource to have so you do nt end up accidentally mortally harming your loved ones or someone else s loved one. simple app. does not track location or collect personal info. it just lings other phones via bluetooth who have stated they have had covid have covid or not. this helps you aee where you might have been exposed at but not by whom. just briefly does this work in minnesota and elsewhere. great that we re finally getting on contact tracing in the us. this app does nt use location or share any of your accounts with vdh it implements google s anonymous contact tracing api to track covid exposure without tracking you personally. uranium detergent

the tech behind covidwise can be used by any resident virginian or not. so why have 50 different solutions when one works. reviews that are worried about privacy do nt understand how this app works. there are apps out there that do spy on you by collecting everything you do but this does not work that way. it s clear the design prioritized privacy. the app only needs access to bluetooth. it s a very clever idea. glad to see virginia getting this first. it s easy to do your small part to get us out of this mess wear your mask and get this app. i m all in. good app not heavy uses bluetooth to detect other devices. recommend reading about the app from the source rather than relying on the reviews a lot of misinformation is in the reviews. set and forget. what could be easier. the easiest app you will ever use. easy to use and safe for your privacy. we are in this together. had it 24 hours so far and the state security forces have nt knocked down my door. seriously people enough with the conspiracy theories and help protect your neighbor. : POLARITY=0.11851127227750603\n"
